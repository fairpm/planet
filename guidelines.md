🌐 **What is Planet FAIR?**

* A community-curated aggregation of WordPress-related blog posts — development, themes, plugins, advocacy, events, and more.

* Inspired by [Planet Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/drupalorg/docs/content/planet-drupal), this version is designed specifically for sites sourcing content from [https://fair.pm](https://fair.pm/). It aims to share valuable WordPress knowledge that visitors might not otherwise encounter.

---

🟢 **Content that is great for Planet FAIR**

* How-tos, guides, and tutorials on using WordPress effectively

* Plugin, theme, and block announcements with meaningful discussion or background (especially from FAIR distributions)

* Case studies showing how WordPress was used in a project

* Presentation slides or notes from WordPress talks and meetups

* Community news, such as initiative progress updates

* Posts about FAIR itself, including updates on FAIR governance, new FAIR features, or community contributions to FAIR

---

🚫 **Content that does not fit Planet FAIR**

* Press releases (should be shared via each site’s own channels when using FAIR)

* Sponsored posts

* Job announcements or hiring calls (mentioning a career change is fine if not the main focus)

* General posts that only mention WordPress briefly

* “I Love WordPress\!” posts without actionable or valuable information

* Posts focused primarily on affiliate links or purely monetized content

---

📝 **Other places for special WordPress-related content**

* Press releases are not included; sites sourcing this from [https://fair.pm](https://fair.pm/) should share those through their own official channels.

* Event announcements should be posted on local Meetup pages, WordCamp, and event websites.
